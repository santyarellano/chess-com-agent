# Welcome to the Chess.com agent!

This project consists of a very simple chess agent that plays on [Chess.com](chess.com). All you need to do is initialize the python project and it'll start playing by itself. It plays using a min-max strategy of depth 3 (So it won't play very well).

## Dependencies

In order to run the project you'll need to install the dependecies listed in the 'dependencies' file.

## How it interacts with Chess.com
